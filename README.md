# üìú READ BEFORE USE
This is **ONLY** for **EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES**,  **I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE** for your actions. **ONLY** use it **IN YOUR SERVER**.

This tool has been created for YOU, not to destroy everything, but to see how a single bot that you have trusted, can destroy your work and everything in your Discord server. Make sure to trust the bots that you invite and the admins that you promote.
